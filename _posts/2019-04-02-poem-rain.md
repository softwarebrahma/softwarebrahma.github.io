A poem on the recent rains in California in the midst of global warming.

## Rain and Us

Mother nature sheds many a tear

For loss of life she nurtured so dear

Tears she did shed but not in vain

For there was life that stood to gain

Ask the high happy hills sporting fresh green looks

Or the lush green valleys spurting new blood in brooks

Yet tears they were that she shed in pain

For troubles we cause she knows she can&#39;t sustain.
