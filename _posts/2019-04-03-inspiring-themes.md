# Inspiring Themes

Some inspiring themes to meditate on..

## Swami Vivekananda

### Thy Love I Fear

This is [Swami Vivekananda][68f14945]&#39;s translation of a Bengali song and it forms a part of a piece he wrote, titled, &quot;[_The Story of the Boy Gopala_](http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_6/writings_prose_and_poems/the_story_of_boy_gopala.htm)&quot;. His guru, [Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa][2e6ea882], used to like this song very much.

```
Thy knowledge, man! I value not,
   It is thy love I fear;
It is thy love that shakes My throne,
   Brings God to human tear.

For love, behold the Lord of all,
   The formless, ever free,
Is made to take the human form
   To play and live with thee.

What learning, they of Vrinda’s groves,
   The herdsmen, ever got?
What science, girls that milked the kine?
   They loved, and Me they bought.
```
